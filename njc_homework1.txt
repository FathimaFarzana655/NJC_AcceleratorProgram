
1) Explain SDLC at a high level

-SDLC or Software design life cycle is a process to produce a high quality software in short period of time.
-It provides a structured flow of phases.
-The different phases in SDLC are :

  -> Feasibility Study 
	-various aspects like the possibility of completing and various requirements for the project is studied

  -> Requirement Analysis
	-the relevant information is collected from the customer to develop a product that meets their expectations.

  -> Design
	-the system and software design documents are prepared as per the requirement
	-helps to define overall system architecture.
	-one of the design is implemented, i.e high level or low level design

  -> Coding
	-in this phase developers start writing the code
	-also the task is divided into different modules and units and are assigned to different team members.

  -> Testing
	-the code that is developed is tested for normal working. various testing like unit, integration etc

  -> Deployment
	-software is deployed for end users

  -> Maintenance
	-maintenance of the s/w post deployment various bugs are fixed that might occur


2) What is waterfall and why it is still relevant

-its a sequential s/w devolepment model
-it is also called as linear model as one phase is started after the completion of the previuos phase
-it is relevant in cases where client has clear cut idea about the s/w to be developed
-also the scope of the project doesnt change
-it is cheap
-relevant in cases where the project is already known to the developers or already familiar with the developers


3) Explain Agile Model with a use case and the role of SCRUM in that

-it is an iterative software development model
-the different phases included are same as waterfall model
-all these phases are included in every iteration
-feedback is taken after each iteration
-after each iteration a small part of software is given to the client
-USE CASE:
	for eg:
	-in the case of WhatsApp in the first iteration the status viewing part is implemented 
	-then in the next iteration profile viewing part is completed 
	-and thereafter till the completion of the entire s/w
-relevance of scrum in agile is that agile is implemented using scrum methodology/framework


4) Who is Scrum Master

-the Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum
-a scrum master guide the team through the scrum process with their experience and expertise.

-Role of scrum master:
	->establishing an env where the team can be effective
	->addressing team dynamics
	->protecting the team from outside interruptions
	->ensuring good relationship between team members


5) Differentiate between Product/Sprint Backlog

-Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product
-Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog
-Product Backlog evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used evolves.
-Product Backlog is dynamic 
-It constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful.

-Sprint is a period of two or three weeks or one month during which a “Done”, useable, and Scrum Sprint is part of the Empirical Process potentially releasable product Increment is created 
-A sprint backlog is a set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint
-It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the development team plans to accomplish during the Sprint 
-it belongs solely to the Development Team


6) What is Epic & Story

Epic:
  -epics are large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (called stories).
  -they are few in number and take longer to complete.
  -epics are made up of stories which can be completed in a month or a quarter

Story:
  -stories are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user.
  -they are something the team can commit to finish within a one or two-week sprint.
  -the completion of related stories leads to the completion of an epic


7) What is called Velocity in SCRUM

-Velocity is a method for accurately measuring the rate at which scrum development teams consistently deliver business value.
-It is an indication of the average amount of Product Backlog turned into an Increment of product during a Sprint.
-At the end of each iteration, the team adds up effort estimates associated with user stories that were completed during that iteration which is called velocity.
-After knowing velocity the team can compute an estimate of how long the project will take to complete
-This is generally an accurate prediction, even though rarely a precise one


8) Explain the SCRUM ceremonies

Scrum has four main ceremonies that bring structure to each sprint:
  
  -Sprint planning:
	->It marks the beginning of the sprint and is timeboxed according to the number of weeks in the sprint
	->there are two main objectives:
		1.The Scrum team decides what items from the product backlog to pull into the current sprint backlog.
		2.The development team forms a plan for delivering the selected backlog items.
	-> The second task of sprint planning focuses on converting the backlog items into tasks the development team can accomplish.

  -Daily stand-up:
	->It occurs on every day of the sprint when there isn’t another ceremony
	->It’s timeboxed at 15 minutes, during which the team comes up with a plan for the next 24 hours.
	->It includes the development team, who run the meeting, and the Scrum master.
	->During this, the team focuses on inspecting progress and identifying any changes to the day’s work.
	
  -Sprint review:
	->At the end of the sprint, the Scrum team holds sprint review.
	->The purpose of sprint review is to inspect the newly created product increment and adapt the product backlog as necessary
	->By the end of sprint review, the Scrum team should have a revised product backlog and a good sense of what items to move to the upcoming sprint.
	->The ceremony is timeboxed for one hour per week of sprint duration

  -Sprint retrospective:
	->A sprint retrospective is held after sprint review, but before the next sprint.
	->every team member will be present and will be sharing their feedback.
	->The purpose of a sprint retrospective is to improve team processes.


9) What is grooming

-The primary purpose of a backlog grooming session is to ensure the next few sprints worth of user stories in the product backlog are prepared for sprint planning.
-some of the objectives of backlog grooming are :
	->Break down large user stories into smaller tasks.
	->Discuss user stories with the team, answer any related questions to smooth out any ambiguity.
	->Ensure upcoming user stories meet the team’s “definition of ready” by adding key contextual information and acceptance criteria.
	->Sometimes the scrum master or project manager and delivery team will use this session to estimate stories and assign story points.


10) How Jira board is effective in SCRUM

-Jira Software is an agile project management tool that supports any agile methodology, be it scrum, kanban, or your own unique flavor.
-it can be used for various use cases - from managing project tasks, to tracking bugs, to doing customer support. 
-JIRA also works great for smaller teams, as well as larger ones. 
-Especially when starting a new business, JIRA can be super useful, since it scalable when the business grows.

11) Differentiate between SCRUM & Waterfall

Scrum:
  -Scrum process can be used when the requirements from the software are not well defined.
  -When changes are required at any phase of the development. 
  -it can implement changes at very low cost at any stage during development.
  -When the freedom to take a decision is needed by the developer and the stakeholders, options are provided to them so that they can take decisions independently. 

Waterfall:
  -When the requirements from the product are clear and have a picture of the result.
  -The customer is very clear, and requirements are well defined and understood, does not require changes.
  -The concern all is about the final product, time is not concerned. Defined schedule and budget are given by the customer.
  -Waterfall model works best when there is less or minimal involvement of the customer.


12) Explain the responsibilities of Product Owner

-The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.
-Product Backlog management includes:
	->Clearly expressing Product Backlog items.
	->Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions.
	->Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs.
	->Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next.
	->Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.

-product owner’s responsibilities are :
	->Defining the vision
	->Managing the product backlog
	->Prioritizing needs
	->Overseeing development stages
	->Anticipating client needs
	->Acting as primary liaison
	->Evaluating product progress at each iteration
